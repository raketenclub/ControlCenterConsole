review description
registered at github... https://github.com/raketenclub/ControlCenterConsole
and pushed all the stuff
now, ... finished so far. theres nothing more i can really do now. 
next days continue working out the details, plan a new prototype - create basic schemes for main circuits and modules as a template, built up a new working prototoype ... do some garden work :)





11.04.2015: 

you can follow the project on twitter, facebook, or g+, 
#rocketlaunch #startbox. 
still a one man show. 
but i got connected to another team with a very similar thingy. go or nogo? thats the question. greeeets! 
im still not sure about what license is the correct one.
tried to join lab75 in ffm, but tarvelling would take too much time, so only virtual participation at home. i got green light and a go from my wife and daughter.

watch the amazing opening ceremony in lab75 frankfurt.

04.04.2015: 

for simplicity i would prefer the picaxe education pic, 
lots of I/O needed. 
i had some experiences with the picaxe as a very beginner in electronics, 
and its easines is fascinating and it has everything needed - 
lots of dac i/o, i2c, sound etc., 
so the project can concentrate on scheme and a detailed description 
of what the cicuit need, the design of the panel/box/(koffer) etc. so we get a good concept, 
and maybe kind of prototype.

03.04.2015: i (kalle) personally will take part in the spacechallenge at lab75 in frankfurt. 
and we will be online (irc/mail, etc) all the time - virtual participation is higly welcome
