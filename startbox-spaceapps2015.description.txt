modular-education-control-center-startbox

codename "control center console" 

the startbox is a mixture of (os)hard- and software.
its meant to be used as an education control center for launching a rocket.
it will show old and young kids the thrill of a rocket launch and all the procedures and let them have a closer look into
 - last but not least they will become a flight operator. 
 the box contains a small standard circuit with the ability to add different modules, such as countdown module, sensor modules (wind, weather, compass, camera), rocket telemetrie and so on.

This project is solving the 3-2-1 LIFTOFF: Launch that Rocket! challenge.

Description

the goal of this project is to design a concept and finaly build a kit for a model rocket startbox acting as a small control center with the ability to add modules like sensors, rocket telemetrie etc.

its meant to use with model rockets to give the young and old kids a view into rocket preparation tasks before and after launch and feel all the pins and needles during process..

the box is built almost from scratch, using small programmable pics, easy electric and electronic cicuits in addition to small pieces of software.

A module could contain sensors for measuring e.g. 

* distances to the launchpad 

* wind and wetaher conditions 

* countdown and other alerts for e.g. light barriers around the launchpad, cameras etc.., almost everything you can think of :)


the hardware will use very simple electronics and software for default tasks, like ignitor circuit checks, countdown, lots of switches and lamps.

output of all sensordata and current task is send via simple serial output and can be used to feed e.g. a gameengine to show the data simulation and telemetire on screen etc. 
(but this would be user contributed pieces of software maybe)

no external computers should be needed to have a fully working control-center but can be added to evaluate data or do other tasks.
in addition, the console is able to receive signals from modules and external computers. 
think of a map with obstacles in which direction the rocket should not start, or computing estimated landing position etc....

some aditional keywords i sshould have mentioned somewhere... 
but my english is very broken. 
so instead of spending hours on correcting, i just spread them out here....

* should be mobile version, or stationary bigger one.

* solid versions for education, schools, universities...., training purposes

*  opensource hardware, software

*  easy electronics

* not expensive 

*  should available as kit and ready to use

* build your own! or get one from a manufacturer

* extendable

* spare parts should all easily available

* programming should be easy

* create own modules

* connect boxes together and share modules

* connect boxes to computer an internet, use real time clocks to synchronous rocket starts

* connect the box to your computer and simulate a launch in a game

* connect the box to computer and make your own games or simulations
 

(sry for my bad english ;-)

irc channel for this project is at sourceforge.net #startbox

a prototype of the startbox was born in 2011 for the CCCamp in Finowfurt, but failed successfully on the field... we continued with a simple battery and 2-wires!
